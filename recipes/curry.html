          Add the salt and baking soda to the water and mix until dissolved.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the vegetable oil to a heavy-bottomed pot such as a dutch oven and
          heat over medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering (but not
          smoking).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the chicken in a single layer with the skin-side down and fry
          undisturbed until the skin is browned and crisp (about 3 minutes).
          Flip the chicken over and brown the second side.
        </p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When the chicken is browned on both sides, remove it from the pan and
          add grated ginger and garlic. Saute until you have a thick layer of
          brown fond on the bottom of the pot and the mixture is caramelized.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Remove the lid and turn up the heat to medium-high, boiling the
          mixture until there is very little liquid left.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the grated carrot and fry the mixture by stirring and then
          spreading the vegetables into an even layer and then stirring again
          until the onions are fully caramelized, and the mixture is cinnamon
          brown.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the curry powder and stir the mixture together until it is very
          fragrant (about 1 minute). Be careful not to burn it.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Add the vegetable stock and banana, and then use a stick blender to
          puree the mixture until smooth.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

          Now you want to return the chicken to the pot along with the potatoes,
          carrots, soy sauce, chunou sauce, tomato paste, bay leaf, star anise,
          and cocoa powder.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Adjust the heat to maintain a gentle simmer and then let this cook
          until the carrots and potatoes are tender (about 1 hour). You'll want
          to mix the curry every 10 minutes or so to make sure it is not burning
          to the bottom of the pot.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The curry is done when the vegetables and chicken are tender, and the
          sauce is very thick. Taste the curry and adjust the seasonings with
          salt and cayenne pepper to taste. If you like a looser curry, you can
          add water to thin it out.
